In this repo we will develop a Git Workflow for Two Programmers

The group Let it be has split into 2 teams, team 1 Abel and Mari; and group 2 Lisa, Galal and Sayed.

This is the repo of team 1

In this development strategy we will take getting to know each other to the next level by working together and communicating changes on one project.
